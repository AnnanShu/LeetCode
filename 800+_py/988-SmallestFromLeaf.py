"""
Given the root of a binary tree, each node has a value from 0 to 25 representing the letters 'a' to 
'z': a value of 0 represents 'a', a value of 1 represents 'b', and so on.

Find the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root.

(As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically smaller: for example, "ab" is
 lexicographically smaller than "aba".Â  A leaf of a node is a node that has no children.)
